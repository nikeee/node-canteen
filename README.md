# node-canteen

A RESTful service that provides information about current canteen menu. Written in TypeScript running in node.js.

To install the dependencies, use:
```
npm install
```

To compile the TypeScript file, use:
```
tsc -m commonjs --removeComments app.ts
```

To run the server:
```
node app
```

Still WIP.
