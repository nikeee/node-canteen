# node-canteen

A RESTful service that provides information about the current canteen menu. Written in TypeScript running in node.js. Currently hosted at http://node-canteen.herokuapp.com.

To install the dependencies and compile the TypeScript, use:
```
npm install
```

To run the server:
```
npm start
```

Still WIP.
